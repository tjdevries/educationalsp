# `educationalsp`

A Language Server built for the educational purpose of understanding **WHAT** LSP is and **HOW** it works.

It doesn't do anything special for any particular language, it is focused on helping you understand what your tools **do**.

This LSP was tested with Neovim, but would likely work inside VS Code.
